Attempted this problem a ridiculous number of times. Good practice learning both JS syntax and experimenting with multilayered algorithms. Observing existing solutions I found that oftentimes when you tried to make it behave like a real elevator with real world constraints it wouldn't pass as many tests (checking for weight, using arrows, etc.).

Final Solution: V7.js in the Attempt 2 folder...
